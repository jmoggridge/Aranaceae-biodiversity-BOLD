To supplement existing digital occurrence records from GBIF, a dataset of new occurrence records was compiled for all species using published literature or online sources, from which geographic coordinates were extracted or interpreted from locality description data. New information A total of 5,104 occurrence records were obtained, of which 2,378 were from literature or online sources other than GBIF. Of these, 2,308 had coordinate data. Reporting years ranged from 1834 to 2017. Most records were from North America and Europe, with Brazil, China, India and Australia also well represented.},

abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics underlying the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity have been controversial for over a century. Using a spatially explicit approach that incorporates not only origination and extinction but immigration, a global analysis of genera and subgenera of marine bivalves over the past 11 million years supports an ‘‘out of the tropics'' model, in which taxa preferentially originate in the tropics and expand toward the poles without losing their tropical presence. The tropics are thus both a cradle and a museum of biodversity, contrary to the conceptual dichotomy dominant since 1974; a tropical diversity crisis would thus have profound evolutionary effects at all latitudes.},

abstract = {Predators can disproportionately impact the structure and function of ecosystems relative to their biomass. These effects may be exacerbated under warming in ecosystems like the Arctic, where the number and diversity of predators are low and small shifts in community interactions can alter carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we show that warming alters the effects of wolf spiders, a dominant tundra predator, on belowground litter decomposition. Specifically, while high densities of wolf spiders result in faster litter decomposition under ambient temperatures, they result, instead, in slower decomposition under warming. Higher spider densities are also associated with elevated levels of available soil nitrogen, potentially benefiting plant production. Changes in decomposition rates under increased wolf spider densities are accompanied by trends toward fewer fungivorous Collembola under ambient temperatures and more Collembola under warming, suggesting that Collembola mediate the indirect effects of wolf spiders on decomposition. The unexpected reversal of wolf spider effects on Collembola and decomposition suggest that in some cases, warming does not simply alter the strength of top-down effects but, instead, induces a different trophic cascade altogether. Our results indicate that climate change-induced effects on predators can cascade through other trophic levels, alter critical ecosystem functions, and potentially lead to climate feedbacks with important global implications. Moreover, given the expected increase in wolf spider densities with climate change, our findings suggest that the observed cascading effects of this common predator on detrital processes could potentially buffer concurrent changes in decomposition rates.},

abstract = {Spiders have been suspected to be one of the most important groups of natural enemies of insects worldwide. To document the impact of the global spider community as insect predators, we present estimates of the biomass of annually killed insect prey. Our estimates assessed with two different methods suggest that the annual prey kill of the global spider community is in the range of 400-800 million metric tons (fresh weight), with insects and collembolans composing {\textgreater}90{\%} of the captured prey. This equals approximately 1{\%} of the global terrestrial net primary production. Spiders associated with forests and grasslands account for {\textgreater}95{\%} of the annual prey kill of the global spider community, whereas spiders in other habitats are rather insignificant contributors over a full year. The spider communities associated with annual crops contribute less than 2{\%} to the global annual prey kill. This, however, can be partly explained by the fact that annual crop fields are “disturbed habitats” with a low buildup of spider biomass and that agrobiont spiders often only kill prey over short time periods in a year. Our estimates are supported by the published results of exclusion experiments, showing that the number of herbivorous/detritivorous insects and collembolans increased significantly after spider removal from experimental plots. The presented estimates of the global annual prey kill and the relative contribution of spider predation in different biomes improve the general understanding of spider ecology and provide a first assessment of the global impact of this very important predator group.},

abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the global latitudinal diversity gradient pattern in spiders is pear-shaped, with maximum species diversity shifted south of the Equator, rather than egg-shaped, centred on the equator, this study infers the gradient using two large datasets. Location: Global terrestrial. Time Period: Data sources range from 1757–2017; data assembled April 2017. Taxon: Spiders (Araneae). Methods: Using metadata on the countries of origin for 98{\%} of all described spider species, this study applies PostGIS queries to calculate the number of species, and the species richness per land area, along ten-degree latitudinal bands. Results: More spider species are known in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. Although the global latitudinal diversity gradient pattern in species richness per area is, indeed, pear-shaped, this pattern only applies to Old World longitudes and only if it is assumed that the species-area relationship is linear. Without this assumption, the latitudinal gradient matches the classic parabolic shape. Main conclusions: Using data from the World Spider Catalog, the global latitudinal diversity gradient pattern for spiders, in terms of species per unit area and assuming a power function for the species-area relationship, is egg-shaped, or parabolic, rather than pear-shaped as previously claimed.},

abstract = {Because many animal species are undescribed, and because the identification of known species is often difficult, interim taxonomic nomenclature has often been used in biodiversity analysis. By assigning individuals to presumptive species, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated, data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between groups of specimens identified to a species through prior taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned for rapid growth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Ratnasingham, Hebert.},

abstract = {In the present study, DNA barcoding was used to assess the percentage accuracy of morphological base identification of spiders from the agriculture fields of district Layyah, Punjab, Pakistan. A total of 872 spiders were captured from June to August of 2017. All the collected spiders were brought to molecular laboratory at GC University Lahore, preserved in 95{\%} ethanol and stored at −20 °C until the DNA extraction. Spiders were evaluated morphologically on the basis of different identification Keys and Catalogs. Morphological identification revealed the presence of 12 families, 29 genra and 49 species. To evaluate the authenticity of morphological identification, tissue samples of 96 specimens were sent to Canadian Center for Biodiversity and Genomics, University of Guelph, Canada. A 658-base pair sequence of COI (Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I) of 90 specimens was retrieved successfully, which confirmed the presence of 11 families, 25 genra and 47 species. On the basis of molecular results, all the misidentified specimens were then allotted the correct taxon. Overall accuracy of morphological based identification was 88{\%}. It is concluded from the present study that morphological investigations to identify a spider, are satisfactory but to enhance the accuracy, pace and credibility of results, molecular technique like DNA barcoding is considerable. Furthermore, to magnify authenticity of evaluation of spiders, integrated barcoding- combination of molecular methods and conventional taxonomy- is compulsory.},

abstract = {Spiders are mega diverse arthropods and play an important role in the ecosystem. Identification of this group is challenging due to their cryptic behavior, sexual dimorphism, and unavailability of taxonomic keys for juveniles. To overcome these obstacles, DNA barcoding plays a pivotal role in spider identification throughout the globe. This study is the first large scale attempt on DNA barcoding of spiders from India with 101 morphospecies of 72 genera under 21 families, including five endemic species and holotypes of three species. A total of 489 barcodes was generated and analyzed, among them 85 novel barcodes of 22 morphospecies were contributed to the global database. The estimated delimitation threshold of the Indian spiders was 2.6{\%} to 3.7{\%} K2P corrected pairwise distance. The multiple species delimitation methods (BIN, ABGD, GMYC and PTP) revealed a total of 107 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) for 101 morphospecies. We detected more than one MOTU in 11 morphospecies with discrepancies in genetic distances and tree topologies. Cryptic diversity was detected in Pardosa pusiola, Cyclosa spirifera, and Heteropoda venatoria. The intraspecies distances which were as large as our proposed delimitation threshold were observed in Pardosa sumatrana, Thiania bhamoensis, and Cheiracanthium triviale. Further, shallow genetic distances were detected in Cyrtophora cicatrosa, Hersilia savignyi, Argiope versicolor, Phintella vittata, and Oxyopes birmanicus. Two morphologically distinguished species (Plexippus paykulli and Plexippus petersi) showed intra-individual variation within their DNA barcode data. Additionally, we reinstate the original combination for Linyphia sikkimensis based on both morphology and DNA barcoding. These data show that DNA barcoding is a valuable tool for specimen identification and species discovery of Indian spiders.},
